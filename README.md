# FizzBuzz in JavaScript

## Task

Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a number as an argument.
`fizzBuzz` will return:
* 'fizz' if the number is a multiple of 3;
* 'buzz' if the number is a multiple of 5;
* 'fizzbuzz' if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5;
* and the number if none of the above apply.

This basic kata was test-drive using Jasmine.
